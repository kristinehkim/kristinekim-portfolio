## General Information
I created this to have a portfolio showcasing all the projects I made encompassing everything that I have learned during this bootcamp.  My goal is to make it into the educational tech industry since I was a teacher and have a lot of background information and knowledge in that area.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Features
- Navigation bar with links scrolling to the corresponding section and to my resume
- Images with links (that will present deployed applications)
- Contact me section in the footer if anyone needs to reach me


## Screenshots

<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->


## Setup
Media query is used to respond to different sized screens and settings.  Background colors change and text will shift.  Flexbox and flexbox placement were used to set up and style the boxes.


## Usage
The links in the nav bar located on the top right of the webpage will jump down to that section of the page.  Each box has an image of a project linking to deployed sites. Alt attributes are included so people with disabilities have web accessibility.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Boxes to be styled more
- Overall styling to be improved

To do:
- Flexbox placement for the boxes
- Add deployed applications once created
